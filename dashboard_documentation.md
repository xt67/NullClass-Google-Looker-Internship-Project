## ðŸŽ› Filters and Controls

The dashboard includes interactive slicers that allow users to explore data across multiple dimensions:

- **Year** â€“ Filter transactions by year (e.g., 2021, 2022).
- **Product Category** â€“ Analyze sales and profits by product type.
- **Payment Method** â€“ View performance by payment type (e.g., credit card, net banking).
- **Value Transaction** â€“ Focus on high or low-value orders.

These filters enable users to drill down into specific segments and time periods to derive insights.

## ðŸ§® Calculated Fields and Logic

The following formulas and calculated fields were used inside Google Looker Studio:

- **Net Profit** = `after_discount - cogs`
- **AOV** = `after_discount / quantity` (based on grouped aggregates)
- Custom filters were applied using logic on:
  - `is_gross`, `is_net`, and `is_valid` flags
  - `order_date` for year-wise filtering
